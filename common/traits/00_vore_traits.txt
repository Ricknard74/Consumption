# voraphobe can be gained through trauma

# Insatiable
#     "No number of prey can satisfy this gluttonous predator."
#     Max num_prey: +2
#     Stress Reduction: −10% on successful vore
#     Risk: Slight chance of prey escaping due to overeating

#Gentle Predator
# "This predator treats their prey with unexpected care."
# Opinion Bonus: Prey loses less opinion
# Release Bonus: Prey gains prestige on escape
# Faith Bonus: More accepted in faiths where vore is tolerated

# Fatalist Prey
# "They no longer fear being consumed — in fact, they may welcome it."
# Opinion: +40 with predators
# Stress Loss: Huge reduction when vored
# Behavior: May choose to sacrifice self

#Reforming Predator
# "This predator has vowed to never consume prey again."
# Blocks: All vore interactions
# Faith Bonus: Piety gain in non-voraphilic faiths
# Events: May be tempted to break vow

# Preyborn
# "This character was reborn through unbirth or digestion."
# Bonus: +2 fertility, +5 attraction opinion
# Mystical Flavor: Good fit for religions with transformation themes
# Backstory: Maybe acquired via a unique scripted birth
